To implement access control and perform operations based on user roles (admin and technician) in PostgreSQL, you'll need to set up roles and permissions, and then structure your SQL queries accordingly.

### 1. Define User Roles

#### Create Roles
1. **Admin Role**:
   ```sql
   CREATE ROLE admin_role;
   ```

2. **Technician Role**:
   ```sql
   CREATE ROLE technician_role;
   ```

#### Grant Privileges to Roles
1. **Admin Role**:
   ```sql
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLE work_order TO admin_role;
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLE maintenance_report TO admin_role;
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLE equipment TO admin_role;
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLE technician TO admin_role;
   ```

2. **Technician Role**:
   ```sql
   GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON TABLE work_order TO technician_role;
   GRANT INSERT ON TABLE maintenance_report TO technician_role;
   GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON TABLE equipment TO technician_role;
   ```

### 2. Set Up User Access

#### Create Users and Assign Roles
1. **Create Admin User**:
   ```sql
   CREATE USER admin_user WITH PASSWORD 'admin_password';
   GRANT admin_role TO admin_user;
   ```

2. **Create Technician User**:
   ```sql
   CREATE USER technician_user WITH PASSWORD 'technician_password';
   GRANT technician_role TO technician_user;
   ```

### 3. SQL Queries for Operations

#### 1. **Technician Viewing and Updating Work Orders**
Technicians can view work orders and update the status.

**Viewing Work Orders**:
```sql
-- Technicians can view their assigned work orders
SELECT * FROM work_order WHERE technician_id = <technician_id>;
```

**Updating Work Order Status**:
```sql
-- Technicians update the status of a work order
UPDATE work_order
SET status = 'completed', updated_at = NOW()
WHERE workorder_id = <workorder_id> AND technician_id = <technician_id>;
```

#### 2. **Technician Submitting Maintenance Reports**
Technicians submit maintenance reports with issues they face.

**Inserting Maintenance Report**:
```sql
-- Technicians submit a maintenance report
INSERT INTO maintenance_report (technician_id, workorder_id, tower_id, equipment_required, issues_faced, priority)
VALUES (<technician_id>, <workorder_id>, <tower_id>, '<equipment_required>', '<issues_faced>', '<priority>');
```

#### 3. **Admin Adding Equipment and Technicians Claiming Equipment**
Admins add new equipment and technicians claim it.

**Admin Adding Equipment**:
```sql
-- Admin adds new equipment
INSERT INTO equipment (workorder_id, tower_id, serial_number, manufacture, model, equipment_name)
VALUES (<workorder_id>, <tower_id>, <serial_number>, '<manufacture>', '<model>', '<equipment_name>');
```

**Technician Claiming Equipment**:
```sql
-- Technician claims the equipment
UPDATE equipment
SET claimed = TRUE, updated_at = NOW()
WHERE equipment_id = <equipment_id> AND claimed = FALSE;
```

#### 4. **Admin Updating Work Order Status After Equipment Claim**
Admins can update the status of the work order after equipment is claimed.

**Admin Updating Work Order Status**:
```sql
-- Admin updates the status of a work order after equipment is claimed
UPDATE work_order
SET status = 'completed', updated_at = NOW()
WHERE workorder_id = <workorder_id>;
```

### Summary

- **Roles and Permissions**: Admins have full access while technicians have limited access.
- **SQL Queries**: Operations are based on rolesâ€”viewing and updating work orders, submitting maintenance reports, adding and claiming equipment.

**Note:** Ensure to replace placeholders like `<technician_id>`, `<workorder_id>`, etc., with actual values when executing the queries. Additionally, manage permissions and roles in a secure and controlled manner to prevent unauthorized access.
